# Commercial licensing: Canvas Web UI

Canvas Web UI is dual-licensed, on the same terms as the rest of the Canvas server
runtime.

**Option 1, AGPL-3.0-or-later.** Free, no agreement needed, nobody to ask. Use
it, modify it, deploy it, sell services around it. The condition is reciprocity:
if you distribute a modified version, or let users interact with one over a
network, those users get the corresponding source of your modifications. See
[LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE](NOTICE).

**Option 2, a commercial licence.** The same code, without the AGPL's
reciprocity obligations, for cases where option 1 does not fit.

Both options cover the same software. There is no cut-down community edition and
no feature held back for paying customers. The AGPL version is the whole product.

## Scope

A commercial licence covers the dual-licensed Canvas components: the server
runtime (`canvas-server`, including the embedding, messaging, voice and agent
services), `canvas-synapsd`, `canvas-stored`, `canvas-neurald` and
`canvas-web`.

It does not cover the standalone Canvas clients: the CLI, the shell client, the
FUSE client, the desktop app and the browser extensions. Those are AGPL-only for
everyone, commercial licensees included.

## When you need option 2

You probably need a commercial licence if you are:

- **Building a hosted or SaaS product on Canvas** and not publishing your
  modifications. This is the common case. Section 13 of the AGPL applies as soon
  as users reach your modified version over a network. Internal-only deployments
  are fine; customer-facing ones are not.
- **Embedding Canvas in a proprietary product** that you distribute.
- **Unable to accept copyleft** for policy, procurement or investor-diligence
  reasons, and needing a licence you can show your counsel rather than an
  argument about where the boundary of a derivative work falls.

You do not need one to run Canvas internally, self-host it for your own team,
evaluate it, contribute to it, or build on it while publishing your changes
under the AGPL.

## Not sure whether you comply?

Ask. An email costs nothing, and it is a much smaller problem to solve now than
after the fact. If you are already running a modified Canvas in production and
have not published the changes, say so. The usual outcome is a licence, not a
dispute.

## Getting one

Email **lic@augmentd.eu** with roughly:

- what you are building, and how Canvas fits into it
- whether you are distributing it, hosting it, or both
- which components you use (server, SynapsD, StoreD, NeuralD, the web UI)
- rough scale, in seats, instances or end customers
